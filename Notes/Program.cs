    while loop vs do while loop:
    A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.
    The do...while loop executes at least once i.e. the first iteration runs without checking the condition.

    Access modifiers:
    - public:       The code is accessible for all classes
    - private:      The code is only accessible within the same class
    - protected:    The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class.
    - internal:     The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly.

    Classes and objects:

    public class Person -> class 
    A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

    Person person2 = new Person(); -> Instances of an object
    An object that is created using a class is said to be an instance of that class.

    public class SuperPerson : Person -> Inheritance
    Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.

    public void Fly() -> method
    A function is directly called by its name, whereas a method includes a code that is called by the object's name.
    me.Fly(); -> method
